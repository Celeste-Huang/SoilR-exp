\linkS4class{ConstantOutFluxRate_by_PoolName}}
\description{
The main purpose of the class is to be used in method signatures 
which would otherwise only indicate an object of class \code{'list'}
in their signature an then check that the list contains the right
kind of elements inside the function.
Using this class the method signature becomes much more informative.
