\arguments{
\item{time_symbol}{A string idicating which of the formal arguments of \code{map} will be considered as time.}

\item{state_variable_ames}{A character vector with the
names of the variables. If present the vector will be used together with 
the map argument. In this case only names in this vector and the time_symbol 
argument are permitted as formal arguments of map.}

\item{map}{A real valued function describing the flux (mass/time)#' as function of the state variables and time.
If \code{state_variables_names} is given  
the names of the formal arguments of \code{map}.
SoilR will then use this imformation to derive a function of one 
vector argument for the state vector and time as required by
the solvers
If \code{state_variable_names} is missing}
