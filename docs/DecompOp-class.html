<h2>decomposition operator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The decomposition operator is a necessary ingredient of any Model. Very
generally it describes the fluxes between the pools and to the exterior as
functions of time and the pool contents.  SoilR arranges different
decomposition operators into different classes, to determine which
computations can be performed with them (which methods can be called on
them). The simplest and least general decomposition operator is
<code><a href="ConstLinDecompOp-class.html">ConstLinDecompOp-class</a></code> which can be created from a constant
reservoir matrix.  Since it is the least general (most specific) the
additional information can be used to compute more and more specific results
(more methods) not available for the more abstract sub classes (for instance
<code><a href="BoundLinDecompOp-class.html">BoundLinDecompOp-class</a></code> that are necessary to model the more
general situations where the decomposition and transfer rates are functions
of time. The different decomposition operators are created by class-specific
functions, called constructors. (see the constructors section of this help
page)
