# SoilR-exp
experimental version of the SoilR-repo

This is the cutting edge.
Some of the features will be removed or changed before the next release.
Many things have to be cleaned up yet.



## Installation
* install.packages("devtools")
* require(devtools)
* devtools::install_github('MPIBGC-TEE/SoilR-exp/pkg')
